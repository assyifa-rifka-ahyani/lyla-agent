# *For any* Due Reminder with ``channel == "device"`` whose user has
# no Device, the tick SHALL NOT call
# ``device_service.queue_device_command`` for that reminder, SHALL NOT
# call WhatsApp, and SHALL leave the reminder's status equal to
# ``ReminderStatus.SCHEDULED`` (no transition).
#
# Strategy: hypothesise the number ``n`` of seeded
# ``channel="device"`` reminders attached to a user that owns *no*
# Device. Monkeypatch ``device_service.queue_device_command`` and
# inject a recording ``whatsapp_send``. Run one tick and assert:
# - ``queue_device_command`` was not called.
# - ``whatsapp_send`` was not called.
# - Every seeded reminder still has ``status == SCHEDULED`` in DB.
# - The returned counter dict is ``{"sent": 0, "failed": 0,
#   "skipped": n}``.
